## Integral
Integral is a language invented by [nph](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/95627/nph).

## FAQ
### Why is it xx bytes? Shouldn't it be yy bytes?
Like most modern golfing languages, which encode an SBCS codepage, Integral encodes the CP437 codepage, in which every character is always 256 bytes. If you want to take a look at the entire codepage, you can go to [constants.js](https://github.com/A-ee/integral/blob/master/constants.js). So, don't be surprised when the code length in UTF-8 is different than the shown code length!

### Why does the interpreter not work?
If anything doesn't work in the online interpreter, try refreshing the interpreter, to clear your browser cache. This works

Also, if you opened https://a-ee.github.io/integral/, that might be another reason that your answer doesn't work. Use https://nph278.github.io/integral/ - that interpreter is more stable, and has a higher change of working out.

If it still doesn't work in https://nph278.github.io/integral/, feel free to raise an issue to the interpreter. Or, if you aren't the post writer, please write a comment to mention the problem.
